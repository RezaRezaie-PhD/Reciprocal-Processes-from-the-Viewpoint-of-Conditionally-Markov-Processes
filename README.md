# Reciprocal-Processes-from-the-Viewpoint-of-Conditionally-Markov-Processes
Reciprocal porocesses have found many applications in different areas of science and engineering, e.g., trajectory modeling, image processing, quantum mechanics, and optimal transportation. There are many papers on the theory of reciprocal processes. But the existing viewpoint for studying reciprocal processes is complicated and leads to complicated results for application. In this project we initiated a new viewpoint for studying reciprocal processes and provide easy-to-apply tools for their application. That is studying reciprocal processes from the viewpoint of a larger set of processes which is conditionally Markov processes.
